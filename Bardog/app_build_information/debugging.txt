		* api exception: 12500:
            - in the firebase console under authentication there are 2 authorised domains
                one of them was missing in the google api console under oauth consent screen (edit page) authorised domains
            - in the firebase console settings there were 2 sha 1 hash keys - debug and release, removing the release key
                and adding it back changed the exception to api exception 10
            - the app name in google console was different from firebase console

		* api exception: 10:
		    - when you add sha 1 fingerprint to firebase google automatically generates the OAuth 2.0
		        Adding both Debug and Release generated 2 Android Clients in the console
		        Removing the Debug key from firebase console and downloading the google-services.json file
		        and don't update the client id in the LoginActivity
		    - signing into the firebase google account in android studio

		* api exception: 12501:
		    - login canceled by user

		* api exception: 16:
		    - appears after 12501 when already signed in

        *********** SOLVED *************
        changed the requestIdToken in Login Activity to the web application ID.
        However, the login won't work in debug mode



*********************************************************** notes ***********************************************************


    * google debug/release keys and the openssl folder are in the bardog folder

    * Release alias is "Bardog Alias"

    * the Release key for the app is at the google play console > הגדרה > שלמות האפליקציה > אישור חתימת האפליקציה

    * google login won't work in debug version because it will result in a failure in both debug and release

    * changed firebase-auth to 20.0.4(3*)
